##Export plugins

The `Save...`/`Save as...` functionality will be implemented with export plugins

###Default export plugin

The default will export `*.book` and `*.article` files.

These are the file that will comply with Meta-Literature's language definition and the only format the GUI Application will understand upon opening a file.

At this moment the nature of this output is being formulated.

###Mardown

It's my intention to have a Mardown export plugin form the get go. Let's hope I don't mess this up tremendously.

###HTML

This one is a must and will be shipping with the initial batch

###PDF

It's, also, my intention to get this one done from the get go. Let's hope I can manage it with grace.
